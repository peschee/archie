# Description #

Archie is a statistics plugin for [Elexis](http://www.elexis.ch), the open source application for management of medical practices, and a framework for developers to display and manage their custom statistical analyses.

# Additional Information #

Please consult the [Archie Summary Website](http://archie.designchuchi.ch) for more information.

# Developers #

Please not that there are two projects in the SVN repository, both under the `/svn/archie` directory:

  * ch.unibe.iam.scg.archie
  * ch.unibe.iam.scg.archie.samples

You'll have to checkout the `trunk` directory of both projects, one of which is the main plugin, another is an Eclipse fragment containing sample statistics. Checking out from the root or `/svn/archie` will get entire trees of both projects, including the tags and branches.

This means `/svn/archie/ch.unibe.iam.scg.archie/trunk` for the main plugin, or `/svn/archie/ch.unibe.iam.scg.archie.samples/trunk` for the samples fragment.
