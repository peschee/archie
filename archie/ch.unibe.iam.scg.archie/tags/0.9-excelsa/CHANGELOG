0.8.1
-----

- Fixed bug where the dataset would not be sorted along with
  the table on the selection page in the chart builder wizard
- Fixed bug where exported filenames would have no filetype attached.

- Added copy selected items command. Items from the main view's 
  table can now be copied into the clipboard.
  
- Removed the private "size" variable from an AbstractDatProvider.
  Only used while running the job and thus does not need to be an object variable.
  Pay attention to this when implementing your data providers.
